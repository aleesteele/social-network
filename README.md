# Social Network
A mock-social network for holiday enthusiasts. I built this at Spiced Academy during week 11 of the 12-week course on Javascript-focused web development. Check out a live demo [here](https://aleesteele-social-network.herokuapp.com/) and the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

## Technologies
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Socket.io
- **Backend**: Node, Express, Socket.io
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, AWS S3

## Description
This was the final taught project that I built at Spiced Academy. We made the petition in order to learn how to build complex full-stack, single-page applications using the popular React, Redux and Socket.io libraries.
